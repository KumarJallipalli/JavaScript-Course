 *  DOM:
 *  ----
 *      - DOM -> Document Object Model
 *      - DOM is a standard object model and programming interface for HTML
 *              - DOM is an Object Model for HTML.
 *              - DOM is an API (Programming Interface) for JavaScript
 *
 *      - With the DOM only, JavaScript can access, modify, add & delete all the elements of an HTML document.
 *      - With the DOM only, JavaScript gets all the power it needs to create dynamic HTML:

    How does DOM created..?
        - When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a "Document Object Model" of that page.
        - The DOM represents an HTML document as a "tree of nodes".
        - These nodes are objects that you can access using JavaScript.
    
        ex: The below HTML code is converted to DOM by browser [when it's 1st loaded in website]
-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>DOM</title>
</head>
<body>
    <div>
        <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Rerum, laborum?</p>
    </div>
</body>
</html>

<!-- 
    Window Object:
    --------------
        - The window object represents the browser's window.
        - All global objects, functions, and variables automatically become members of the window object.
                - Global variables are properties of the window object.
                - Global functions are methods of the window object.
                
        - Even the HTML DOM is a property of the window object:
                - Window.document -> Returns a reference to the document that the window contains.

        - The window object is a global object, so you can omit it when calling its child object.
                - i.e., instead of "window.cosole.log("Hello..!")", we can use "console.log("Hello..!")"
                - similarly, we can use "document.method()" to get the DOM, instead of "window.document.method()"
-->


<!-- 
    document object:
    ----------------
        - The "document" object is the entry point for all HTML elements
        - It’s called the "Document Object Model" but NOT "Window Object Model" 
                - because we’re mostly going to work with the "document" object instead of the Window object.
-->

<!-- 
    DOM Tree:
    ---------
        - The window object is the root/root-node of the DOM tree
        -       window > document > html > head | body [ and their respective child nodes]
        - you can access the whole "HTML" Element node using "document.documentElement", 
        - Access the document "head" using the "document.head" property & the "body" using "document.body"
-->


<!-- 
    Summary:
    --------
        - The DOM is a tree-like structure generated from the HTML file [by browser]
        - Browser then exposes this DOM as a set of JS objects that we can access, such as window & document objects.
