/**
 *  API:
 *      - API - application programming interface
 *      - An API is a set of rules/protocols that enables software applications to communicate with each other to exchange data, features and functionality.
 *      - APIs simplify and accelerate the software development by allowing developers to integrate data, services and capabilities from other applications, instead of developing them from scratch.
 *      - APIs helps in abstarction which allows sharing of only the required information, while keeping other internal system details hidden, 
 *              - This helps with system security. Servers or devices do not have to fully expose data
 * 
 *      - previously, the data to be exchanged is in the form of "XML" [ which is a bit complex ]
 *      - Now, that data is exchanged in the form of "JSON"

/**
 *  JSON:
 *      - JSON is plain text written in JavaScript object notation
 *      - JSON is a lightweight data-interchange format
 *      - JSON format is syntactically similar to the code for creating JavaScript objects. [ keys should be in string format only]
 *      - Since the format is text only, JSON data can easily be sent between computers, and used by any programming language.
 *      - JSON format - '{"name":"John", "age":30, "car":null}'

/**
 *  How to make a JSON from JS objects..?
 *          1. NO variable, only { }
 *          2. write down the properties just like an object 
 *          3. make all the keys in "string" format

/**
 * JavaScript has a built in function for converting JSON strings into JavaScript objects:  - JSON.parse()
 * JavaScript also has a built in function for converting an object into a JSON string:     - JSON.stringify()
