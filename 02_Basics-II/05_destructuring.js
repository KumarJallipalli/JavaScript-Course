/**
 *  What if, we have to extract huge data..?
 *      - JS has simplified this process of extracting the data from ES6 with "Destructuring"
 * 
 *  "Destructuring" is a JS expression/syntax that allows us to extract data from arrays, objects and assign them to variables. 
 *      - syntax: let { var1, var2 ... } = obj_name
 *              - here, var1, var2... must be the key_names from obj, otherwise data won't be extracted
 *      - we cannot omit let (or) const keyword     ex: {name} = user --> throws error
 *      - we cannot use the pre-declare variable names      ex:let name;    {name} = user --> throws error

/**
 *  We can do much more with destructuring in JS
 *          1. In destructuring objects, var_names must be same as key_names from object
 *          2. We can add a new variable while destructuring and add a default value to it.
 *                  - If the var_names doesn't match with key_names, then data won't be extracted & gives undefined
 *                  - In those cases, we ca assign some default values to the new varibles.
 *          3. You can give an alias name to the destructured variables. [we can use both original & alias names]
 *          4. Destructuring in nested objects
 *          5. Destructuring in function parameters
