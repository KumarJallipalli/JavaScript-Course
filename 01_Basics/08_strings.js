/**
 *  Strings
        - `Strings`  are sequence of characters
        - We can use either single or double quotes to represent sequence of characters in JS
*/



/**
 *  Template Literals ( ` ` )
        - **Template Literals** use back-ticks (` `) rather than the quotes (" " or ' ') to define a string
        - It is an ES6 feature

/**
 *  Strings (vs) Template Literals
        - **Template Literals** allow both single and double quotes inside a string [ without any worries ]
            - let text = `He's often called "Johnny"`;
        - **Template Literals** allow multiline strings & it is displayed as it is in console
        - **Template Literals** provide an easy way to interpolate/embed variables and expressions into strings using `${ }`
            - Automatic replacing of expressions with real values is called **string interpolation**.
            - let text = `Welcome ${firstName}, ${lastName}!`;
            - let total = `Total: ${(price * (1 + VAT)).toFixed(2)}`;
